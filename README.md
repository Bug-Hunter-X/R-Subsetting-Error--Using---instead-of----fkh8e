# R Subsetting Error: Using = instead of ==

This repository demonstrates a common error in R when subsetting data frames: using the assignment operator `=` instead of the equality operator `==`.

The file `bug.R` contains code that shows the incorrect usage. The file `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected code.

This error can lead to unexpected results or errors, so it's important to be aware of the difference between `=` and `==` in R.

**Key Differences**
* `=` is the assignment operator (assigns values to variables).
* `==` is the equality operator (compares two values for equality).
